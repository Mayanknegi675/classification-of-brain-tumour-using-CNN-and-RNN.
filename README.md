Brain Tumour Classification using Deep Learning (RNN)
Developed an automated brain tumour classification system using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) on MRI images to support medical diagnosis.
Performed image preprocessing including resizing and normalization to improve model performance and consistency.
Implemented feature extraction and sequential modeling techniques to capture complex patterns in MRI data.
Built and trained the model using Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV in a GPU/CPU-based environment.
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, achieving reliable classification results.
Analyzed limitations of traditional ML methods (SVM, KNN) and demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning-based approaches.
Proposed future enhancements such as hybrid CNN–RNN architectures and real-time deployment for clinical use.
